## Instructions

### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

1. Review [Intro to Digital Accessibility](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gjn16bgjeWCnKNmCwW-0cxUpbQXR0TPfjDSTN7TFcRA/edit#slide=id.g421c16c3f6_5_365) slides.
2. Review the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
3. Complete the [Teach Access](https://teachaccess.github.io/tutorial/#/0) tutorial.

### Perform an accessibility audit of an open source project.

1. Find an open source project to audit for accessibility. This could be a project's website, github repository, or some other aspect of the project (associated tutorials, etc.) You are also welcome to use ITP course materials. Here are some suggested projects if you are feeling stuck:
    * [ml5.js website](https://ml5js.org/)
    * [p5.js website](https://p5js.org/)
    * [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)
    * [Processing website](https://processing.org/)
    * [ICM OOP programming tutorial](https://shiffman.github.io/Learning-p5.js/ch08.html)
    * [The Nature of Code book](https://natureofcode.com/book/)
    * [Programming from A to Z tutorials](https://shiffman.net/a2z/)

2. Use an automated accessibility checker. Here are some suggested ones:
    * [WAVE Browser Extension](http://wave.webaim.org/extension/)
    * [Color Contrast Analyzer](https://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/)
    * [Google Chrome Accessibility Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb)

3. Review the materials manually yourself with a screen reader. 
    * [Mac OS Voiceover](https://help.apple.com/voiceover/mac/10.14/), [Mac Accessibility Support](https://support.apple.com/accessibility/mac)
    * [JAWS free trial for Windows](https://www.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/JAWS)

### Document your findings

Write up the results of your audit in a blog post and link above. If you are feeling ambitious you could file an issue with the project and/or a pull request. This [reporting templates with resources]() might be helpful.
