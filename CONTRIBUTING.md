# Contributing to Open Source Studio at ITP

## Who can contribute?
**Everyone** is welcome to engage in the open source project that is the organisation you are currently viewing. We encourage discussion and contribution from outside the student body of the class. 

The only limitation as an outside collaborator is the actual class meeting space, a seminar-style meeting in person. This is a private space for the enrolled students to discuss, question, and collaborate on assignments around the practice and philosophy of open source.

## How to contribute
Please consider our [code of conduct](https://github.com/Open-Source-Studio-at-ITP/Playground/blob/source/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all your interactions with our project. 

### Substantive changes
In general, before making a pull request that alters the *substance* of a document (e.g., changing the terms of the licence or adding rules to a code of conduct), discuss the change first by opening an issue, or commenting on an open issue. Possible exceptions include if the change was discussed in class, or if you are Dan.

Use helpful commit messages where possible. For example, "Add diversity statement to Code of Conduct" is more helpful than the default "Update CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"

### Assignment additions
Assignment pull requests do not require a new issue, but be sure to identify which assignment you are submitting in the name of your Pull Request (e.g., "Add [Name] week 4 assignment")
